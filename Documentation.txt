🐍 Snake Game (C# Windows Forms)

A classic Snake Game built using **C# Windows Forms**, focusing on simplicity, clean UI design, and beginner-friendly game logic.

---

🎯 Project Overview

This project recreates the traditional Snake game using basic **Windows Forms controls** instead of advanced graphics libraries.
The goal was to understand game loops, UI handling, and event-driven programming in C#.

 🎨 Design Choices

 Visual Design

* The snake and food are created using **Panel controls**.
* Each panel represents one grid cell, making positioning and collision handling simple.
* Panels are shown/hidden instead of opening new forms to keep the UI smooth.

Layout

* **Main Menu**: Start, Level Select, Exit
* **Level Selection Panel**: Easy, Medium, Hard
* **Game Panel**: Where the snake moves
* **Side Panel**: Score, High Score, Level, Pause button

---

 🧠 Game Logic

* The snake is stored as a `List<Panel>`, where each panel is one body segment.
* Each segment stores its grid position using the `Tag` property.
* A **Timer** acts as the game loop and controls movement speed.

 ⚙ Difficulty Levels

| Level  | Behavior                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Easy   | Slow speed, wall wrap-around     |
| Medium | Faster, wall collision ends game |
| Hard   | Fastest speed, high difficulty   |

Difficulty is managed by changing the timer interval.

 🎮 Controls

* **Arrow Keys / W A S D** → Move snake
* **Spacebar / Pause Button** → Pause / Resume
* Reverse direction is blocked to prevent instant collision.

---

🚀 Performance

* Double buffering is enabled to reduce flickering.
* Only required controls are updated during gameplay for smooth performance.

---

 🎨 Customization

* Snake color can be changed using menu options.
* Score and High Score are displayed in real time.

---

 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

* Event-driven programming
* UI state management
* Basic game development concepts in C#

The design is simple, readable, and easy to extend with new features.
